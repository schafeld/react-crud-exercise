# React CRUD Application

## Exercise Description

Create a basic React CRUD application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete items. The application should have the following features.

1. A form to add new items with fields for the item name and description.
2. A list to display all items with options to edit or delete each item.
3. A modal or confirmation dialog for deleting items.
4. Validation for the form fields to ensure that the item name is not empty and the description is not too long.
5. Use functional components and hooks (useState, useEffect) for state management.
6. Use CSS for styling the application, but you can use a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Material-UI if you prefer.
7. Use local storage to persist the items so that they remain even after a page refresh.
8. Implement error handling for any potential issues (e.g., local storage access).
9. Optionally, you can add a search feature to filter the items by name.
10. Optionally, you can add a sorting feature to sort the items by name or date added.

Feature list is to be continued.

## Best Practices

1. Use English language for all code comments and documentation.
2. Follow React best practices for component structure and state management.
3. Use meaningful variable and function names.
4. Keep the code clean and well-organized.
5. Use TypeScript for type safety where sensible.
6. Write unit tests for the components and functions.
7. Use Tailwind CSS for styling the application.
